There are two projects :

1) Both of them deal with data cleaning and extensive exploratory data analysis
2) Both the projects were done using python

***GDP ASSIGNMENT***

The data is sourced from https://data.gov.in/, an Open Government Data (OGD) platform of India. The data for GDP analysis of the Indian states is divided into two parts:

Data I-A: This dataset consists of the GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) data for the states and union territories.

Data I-B: This dataset contains the distribution of GSDP among three sectors: the primary sector (agriculture), the secondary sector (industry) and the tertiary sector (services) along with taxes and subsidies. There is separate dataset for each of the states. 

 ## There are two parts to this project. In the first part, i  will analyse and compare the GDPs of various Indian states (both total and per capita). The GDP of a state is referred to as the GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product). Then, i will divide the states into four categories based on the GDP per capita, and for each of these four categories, i will analyse the sectors that contribute the most to the GDP (such as agriculture, real estate, manufacturing, etc.)

 ## In the second part, i will analyse whether GDP per capita is related to dropout rates in schools and colleges.
 
***Loan Default Case Study***
 
 ## This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their instalments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

 ## In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
